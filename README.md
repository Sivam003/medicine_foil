# **Medicine Foil Name Detection Using AI üì∑üíä**

This project is an AI-based system that identifies the name of medicines from torn foil images using **OpenCV**, **EasyOCR**, and **Flask**. It combines **Computer Vision**, **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)**, and **Machine Learning** for accurate and efficient medicine name prediction.

## **Project Workflow üõ†Ô∏è**

1. **Image Upload**:  
   The user uploads a torn medicine foil image via the web interface.  

2. **Preprocessing with OpenCV**:  
   - Converts the image to grayscale.  
   - Reduces noise for better text detection.  
   - Enhances image features for OCR.  

3. **Text Extraction with EasyOCR**:  
   - OCR extracts readable text from the foil image.  

4. **Text Matching**:  
   - Extracted text is compared with a predefined database using **Pandas** and **FuzzyWuzzy** for similarity scoring.  

5. **Prediction Display**:  
   - The predicted medicine name is displayed to the user.  
   - A "Processing..." buffer animation is shown during image analysis.
