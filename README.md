🎥 Project Title: Medicine Foil Name Detection Using AI 📷💊

🚀 About the Project:
This project demonstrates an AI-based system that detects and predicts the name of medicines from torn foil images. Using cutting-edge tools like OpenCV, EasyOCR, and Flask, the project processes uploaded images, extracts text, and accurately identifies medicine names. It’s a perfect integration of Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and Web Development.

🛠️ Technologies Used:
Front-end: HTML, CSS, Flask (Web Framework)
Back-end: Python, OpenCV, EasyOCR, Pandas, FuzzyWuzzy
Tools: Visual Studio Code, Google Chrome
Hardware Requirements: Minimum 4GB RAM, Windows 10 / Ubuntu 20.04

📋 Project Workflow:

Upload a torn medicine foil image.
Image preprocessing using OpenCV (grayscale conversion, noise removal, etc.).
Text extraction using EasyOCR for optical character recognition.
Matching extracted text with a database of medicines using Pandas and FuzzyWuzzy.
Display the predicted medicine name.
User-friendly interface powered by Flask.
💡 Key Features:
✅ Upload torn medicine foil images.
✅ Fast and accurate prediction of medicine names.
✅ Real-time buffer icon ("Processing...") while the image is being analyzed.
✅ Seamless integration of AI and web development tools.

📚 What You Will Learn:

How to integrate OpenCV for image preprocessing.
Using EasyOCR for text recognition.
Building a complete AI-based project with Flask as the web framework.
Combining data analysis libraries like Pandas and FuzzyWuzzy.
